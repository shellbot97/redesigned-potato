Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]

  1. testcase(1) i/p and o/p (Best Case)
    >>nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
    >>[0, 1]
  2. testcase(2) i/p and o/p (Average case) 
    >>nums = [2, -1, 11, 11], target = 10
    >>[1,2]
  3. testcase(3) i/p and o/p (Worst case)
    >>nums = [1, 3, 4, 5, 2], target = 10
    >>[0,3]
